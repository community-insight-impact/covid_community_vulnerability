# The COVID County Vulnerability Index

## Context
This project was started during the New Lab COVID-19 [Data Hack](https://newlab.com/covid-19-data-hack/) and aims to provide a variety of indices to assess
community vulnerability to COVID-19 infections, adverse health outcomes, and disparate socio-economic harms. We intend this to be usuable by a variety of 
stakeholders: by healthcare systems to identify testing and service deserts and effectively allocate existing resources, by community organizations to
find outreach areas and understand needs, and by policy makers to inform funding and decision making.

## Data
Our dataset contains a range of health care, public health, physical and community infrastructure, socio-economic, demographic, and COVID-19 specific 
information at the US county level. We include data from the following open access sources:
+ The New York Times COVID-19 [Data Repository](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data)
+ [The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation County Health Rankings and Roadmaps Program](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data)
+ The Federal Communications Commission [Form 477 County Data on Internet Access Services](https://www.fcc.gov/general/form-477-county-data-internet-access-services)

## Scoring
We implement a variety of vulnerability scores to help stakeholders assess needs in their area and plan how to best allocate their efforts and resources. The currently available scores are:
+ Severe COVID Complications
+ Food Access Difficulties
+ Risk of Economic Harm
+ Community Connectedness
+ Mental Health Support Needs
+ Mobile Healthcare Impact 
+ Overwhelming Healhcare Systems
+ Information Deserts  

Full definitions of each of these scores can be found in the [data dictionary](data/scores_data_dictionary.md)
