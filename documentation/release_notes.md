### January 11
- You can view and interact with our dataset and vulnerability indices on our [web app](https://dash-cvi-dashboard.herokuapp.com)!
- Current Projects
  - [Community Clustering](https://github.com/community-insight-impact/community_clustering) explores unsupervised learning methods to understand community similarities.
  - [Longitudinal Study](https://github.com/community-insight-impact/longitudinal_metrics) creates a longitudinal version of our dataset that allows us to plot scores over time by county and in aggregate. The longitudinal dataset is explored for large shifts in score behavior and look for corresponding policy events. Secondarily, it is compared to other similar products and see how ours matches or deviates and if we can explain any deviations.
  - [Supervised Severity](https://github.com/community-insight-impact/supervised_severity) uses a supervised model for the severe cases metric to either replace the current score or refine the weighting.
- Current Partnership Projects
  - [UCLA Partnership](https://github.com/community-insight-impact/cvi_ucla_partnership): CII is developing a more specific version of the CVI in collaboration with the UCLA Center for Neighborhood Knowledge’s Renter Vulnerability Index. This dashboard will map  neighborhoods in New York City by concentration of people at risk of missing next month’s rent due to COVID-related economic harm. The aim of this tool will be to help public agencies effectively target renter protection policies and outreach, and make optimal use of resources. 
  - Planned Parenthood: CII is currently partnering with Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri, supporting the organization in its mission to provide reproductive health care services and education. We are developing a customized vulnerability metric for identifying communities lacking in sexual health care with the goal of helping Planned Parenthood identify where their services are most needed.
- Updated view of the [ArcGIS dashboard](https://pumagic.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/be9712cf50f843f5a346ea145e82e01c):
