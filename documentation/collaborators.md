PhD in computational particle physics, currently doing Machine Learning research with Princeton University. My work focuses on developing accelerated ML methods for particle physics reconstruction and AI for social good applications. Previously, I had been focusing on modeling opioid abuse behavior in Appalachia.

MA in Research and Experimental Psychology with an emphasis in statistics and cognitive psychology.  My research was on abstract and 
metaphorical learning, and how these theories can be applied in k-12 schools.  I have been transitioning into a data science role, and
currently work at a non-profit startup using NLP techniques to track unwanted content on social media.

I have an undergraduate degree in Sociology with experience working in public health research. I have experience doing lit reviews, collecting data, managing and analyzing data, qualitative data collection and analysis, and report write up. in the fall, I am going to UCLA for a Master of Urban Planning and I am thinking of getting an MS in community public health (for background on my interest). I have experience in stats analysis on Stata/R. I'm a beginner learning python as well as ArcGIS. I also have experience with program management. The main research projects I've been involved with over the past few years center around improving healtcare access for people who are vulnerable or marginalize (i.e. people who use drugs, HCV+, HIV, LGBTQ, racial minorities)

I recently completed my Master in Public Health in epidemiology from Columbia University. Currently, I am a Health Economics & Outcomes Research Associate at Pfizer. Prior to this, I was grounded in medical anthropology and qualitative research. As a Fulbright Researcher, I collected stories from ex-migrant women in Indonesia about how they became HIV positive. I broadened my skill set to quantitative and spatial analysis to better fight for health injustice.
