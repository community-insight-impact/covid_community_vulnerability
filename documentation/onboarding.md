 ### What is the COVID Vulnerability Project?
  - [Our team](https://github.com/savvy379/covid_county_vulnerability/blob/master/documentation/collaborators.md) 
  - [Dashboard](https://arcg.is/5OLSH)
  
We aim to shed light on areas most heavily affected by the COVID pandemic, down to the county level.  In this rapidly shifting time,
our website provides up to date indicators on a county's economic risk, severity of complications, and mobility health needs. 
Our conrtributors have backgrounds as public health policy researchers, web developers, and engineers. <br>
We are designing an interactive application to visually track county demographics, severe case complications, pre-existing health
conditions.

We believe everyone has the insight to contribute where necessary, regardless of background.  It's fine to focus on one specific area
of the project, or to get out of your comfort zone and try something new.  We are currently focused on meeting
milestones, and tasks are divided up among teammembers to meet those deadlines. <br>
Because we are in the earlier stages of the project, we are active on Slack and hold regular meetings within teams.  We also hold a 
weekly meeting for everyone to update their progress and share what they have been working on.  
       
### Best Practices
