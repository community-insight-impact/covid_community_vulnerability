## Methodology

Our metrics are constructed using the following procedure:
Each variable is normalized based on the full set of US counties to a scale of 0 to 100. Each of the normalized indicators 
is combined linearly (with weights as described in the table below) and the final score is divided by the number of factors 
included*weights to get a final score between 0 and 100. Weights were determined through a review of published CDC information
and other relevant literature.

These metrics will be improved further in our Phase 2 upgrade. Phase 2 will also incorporate additional data 
identified by our literature review team. We are also exploring machine learning based improvements including developing 
supervised predictive models to inform the metric weights and unsupervised methods to explore community clustering and group
vs individual effects.
