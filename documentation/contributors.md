|Nataly Rios has an undergraduate degree in Sociology with experience working in public health research. She has experience doing lit reviews, collecting data, managing and analyzing data, qualitative data collection and analysis, and report write up. In the fall, she is going to UCLA for a Master of Urban Planning and is thinking of getting an MS in community public health (for background on interest). She has experience in stats analysis on Stata/R. I'm a beginner learning python as well as ArcGIS. She also has experience with program management. The main research projects Nataly's been involved with over the past few years center around improving healtcare access for people who are vulnerable or marginalize (i.e. people who use drugs, HCV+, HIV, LGBTQ, racial minorities)           |

|Stephanie Santo is a mental health counseling intern, International Council of Psychologists graduate intern, and recent graduate of New York University where she earned her MA in counseling for mental health and wellness. Two years ago, she earned her BS in psychology from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a double major in health/interpersonal communication, a minor in sociology, and a certificate in crime, society, and law, as well as certificates in leadership and diversity. She attended Columbia University’s summer human rights certificate program in 2017. She is currently a non-traditional pre-medical student with interests in computer science, data science, biotechnology, machine learning, artificial intelligence, biomedical engineering, business, and all types of math. She has received multiple awards for her disability and mental health advocacy on campus and was told “there could be no better mental health counselor”. Thus, she hopes to bring a policy, law, and advocacy lens to whatever she does. At UIUC, she graduated with highest distinction and was an active part of Design for America and was brought onto her school’s national team (which worked on self-driving car safety) to bring a social impact/human behavior lens to the project. At NYU, her team was a finalist in the Healthcare Makethon partially due to her ability to ponder the social implications of the project (about mitigating the social isolation and loneliness of senior citizens) and troubleshooting ahead of times. She aims to bring her research skills to the public health aspect of this project and her data skills as applicable.           |

| YiJyun Lin                    | 
| :---------------------------------------------------------------- | 
|Over the past several years, YiJyun Lin has worked as a teaching assistant for the graduate-level quantitative research method course, a research assistant for faculty in the department. YiJyun is familiar with advanced statistical models, such as multilevel models, spatial analysis and mostly use R, STATA, and GIS for research. YiJyun currently serves as a data analysis consultant at the University of Nevada, Reno, providing training for data analysis to postdocs, graduate, and undergraduate students. 

Meanwhile, YiJyun has been working collaboratively with scholars and colleagues who have expertise in machine learning and natural language processing. Drawing the idea from own dissertation work, YiJyun is working with an Ivy League Hackathon team on a project in which we explore potentials to develop an AI chatbot, which will be trained by machine learning with image and text data, for mitigation in the aftermath of climatic disasters. Also, YiJyun has been working with Dr. Alejandro Quiroz Flores on a project in which we explore how a human-in-the-loop approach can enhance natural language processing to deal better with the bias and generalizability of different algorithms in extracting events in and beyond a sentence and for detecting public health misinformation. Together with Dr. Robert Ostergard and some colleagues, we discovered biases related to public health information for AI training by combining experts and non-experts’ opinions to understand what issues are common within both interpretations of public health policy. These experiences have built confidence and a deep interest in behavioral research and data science.

Prior to pursuing this path, she attained Master of Arts in International Relations from Durham University. For her dissertation, Rosa was one of two people in the department to utilize a quantitative approach. By analyzing survey results and drawing a causal connection using the statistical computing software, SPSS, she was able to effectively convey a correlation between social identity and presidential candidate selection. While data has become a large component of her life, to date, she favor qualitative work. 
Before pursuing graduate studies, she worked as a copywriter for a leading internet marketing solutions company. Overall, as she hope this brief description alludes to, she have a wide-ranging background and set of skills that she's been able to successfully make use of.

She also helped collect to organize the samples and create our database in which they are stored. During training, she valued learning as much as possible from the analytical and laboratory part in routine and genetic tests, putting this learning into practice in her Ph.D. thesis.
Her years' experience in the genetics laboratory consisted of incredibly collaborative work not only with group members but also with colleagues from five different research groups who share the same space. Besides developing our projects, Natália is also able to participate in the Social Media Commission of the Postgraduate Program in Structural and Functional Biology, in which we try to disseminate science in an accessible language for the non-scientific community through social media.
