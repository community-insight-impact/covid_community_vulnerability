| PhD in computational particle physics, currently doing Machine Learning research with Princeton University. My work focuses on developing accelerated ML methods for particle physics reconstruction and AI for social good applications. Previously, I had been focusing on modeling opioid abuse behavior in Appalachia.                                                       |

|I have an undergraduate degree in Sociology with experience working in public health research. I have experience doing lit reviews, collecting data, managing and analyzing data, qualitative data collection and analysis, and report write up. in the fall, I am going to UCLA for a Master of Urban Planning and I am thinking of getting an MS in community public health (for background on my interest). I have experience in stats analysis on Stata/R. I'm a beginner learning python as well as ArcGIS. I also have experience with program management. The main research projects I've been involved with over the past few years center around improving healtcare access for people who are vulnerable or marginalize (i.e. people who use drugs, HCV+, HIV, LGBTQ, racial minorities)           |

|I recently completed my Master in Public Health in epidemiology from Columbia University. Currently, I am a Health Economics & Outcomes Research Associate at Pfizer. Prior to this, I was grounded in medical anthropology and qualitative research. As a Fulbright Researcher, I collected stories from ex-migrant women in Indonesia about how they became HIV positive. I broadened my skill set to quantitative and spatial analysis to better fight for health injustice.           |

|Stephanie Santo is a mental health counseling intern, International Council of Psychologists graduate intern, and recent graduate of New York University where she earned her MA in counseling for mental health and wellness. Two years ago, she earned her BS in psychology from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a double major in health/interpersonal communication, a minor in sociology, and a certificate in crime, society, and law, as well as certificates in leadership and diversity. She attended Columbia University’s summer human rights certificate program in 2017. She is currently a non-traditional pre-medical student with interests in computer science, data science, biotechnology, machine learning, artificial intelligence, biomedical engineering, business, and all types of math. She has received multiple awards for her disability and mental health advocacy on campus and was told “there could be no better mental health counselor”. Thus, she hopes to bring a policy, law, and advocacy lens to whatever she does. At UIUC, she graduated with highest distinction and was an active part of Design for America and was brought onto her school’s national team (which worked on self-driving car safety) to bring a social impact/human behavior lens to the project. At NYU, her team was a finalist in the Healthcare Makethon partially due to her ability to ponder the social implications of the project (about mitigating the social isolation and loneliness of senior citizens) and troubleshooting ahead of times. She aims to bring her research skills to the public health aspect of this project and her data skills as applicable.           |
