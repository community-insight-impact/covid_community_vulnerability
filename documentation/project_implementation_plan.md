To see a summary of updates and new features, check out the [Release Notes](https://github.com/savvy379/covid_county_vulnerability/blob/master/documentation/release_notes.md)


This is an open source project designed to enable various community stakeholders (healthcare systems, policy makers, non-profits, etc) to effectively understand community needs and allocate the resources. 


## Phase I: Beta Dashboard Development

The first app will provide the ability to map these metrics and the underlying variables. Users will be able to select what they want the map to display and interact with the map by zooming in on specific areas, searching for specific counties, and hovering to view precise information. We plan to add additional visualization tools such as plotting summary statistics and comparing counties or areas.

### Metrics
 &nbsp; :heavy_check_mark: **Select priority metrics** <br>
 &nbsp; :heavy_check_mark:  **Complete literature review** <br>
 
 ### Dashboard
 &nbsp; :heavy_check_mark:  **Develop user accessible app with functionality to:** <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plot priority metrics <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plot additional variables <br> 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interact with and adjust the map <br>

## Phase II: Scalable Dashboard Development 

Our data is drawn from a variety of open access sources, and the complete list can be found here. All data has been cleaned and incorporated into a merged dataset with each county identified by its name, state, and FIPS code. This merged and cleaned data set can also be made available to other researchers as a second deliverable. 

### Metrics 
- Improve functionality of remaining metrics and add plotting functionality
- Explore methods to create predictive outcomes on metrics with machine learning  


### Dashboard
- Collect test audience feedback and incorporate into dashboard 
- Add ability for users to create their own linear metrics 
- Add ability for users to add their own data sets 

### Publicity 
- Begin strategies to widely publicize 
- Write articles to publicize
